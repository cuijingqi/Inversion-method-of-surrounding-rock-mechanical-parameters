Step 1: Generate multiple sets of data combinations within the parameter range using orthogonal experimental design, uniform distribution, random generation, and Latin hypercube sampling techniques.
Step 2: Calculate the data generated in Step 1 using the FLAC model sequentially.
Step 3: Combine rock mechanics parameters and calculated displacement and input them into the EO-LightGBM hybrid model for training, constructing the relationship between mechanical parameters and displacement.
Step 4: Input the monitoring displacement in the actual engineering into the trained model to output the rock mechanics parameters.

Note: We will collect more engineering data and maintain these codes and data for a long time to facilitate learning for more readers.
